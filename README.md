#### _Are you worried about asteroids colliding with earth? Don't panic! The Epicodus Space Besties Team has made this application specifically for you, the Asteroidphobe!_

#### _We know you wake up in a cold sweat every morning wondering if an asteroid will come careening into the atmosphere, and we've got you covered!_

#### _With our application, you can time your daily activities to coincide with times of safety and security! If you get flattened by an asteroid, let's make sure it's when you're alone, and not in the middle of ordering coffee from that cute barista at your neighborhood cafe._

 _Made with Angular2 & the NASA NEO (Near Earth Object) API._

## Description

_Using NASA's Near Earth Object Api, we at Space-Besties-Team have built an application that tracks the small dangerous celestial objects near earth for the current day. You will first arrive at the home page and see a series of 'cards', that each contain information for a single near earth object._

_Properties of these objects include: Whether or not they are potentially hazardous, their Approach Date, their Relative Velocity in Miles Per Hour, their Estimated Diameter in Miles, and their Absolute Magnitude (a measurement of true brightness, primarily determined by its size, and by its temperature)._

_You will also notice that each card has a high contrast background color that quickly tells you whether or not the objects are potentially hazardous. Green means you're safe, yellow means you should look more closely! A link is also provided if you would like to gather more specific information from NASA.gov._

_Lastly, on the Nav Bar at the top of the page, there is a link to a page of Resources for those inclined to learn more about Earth's history with Asteroids, and an About page, if you'd like to get to know our team!_
